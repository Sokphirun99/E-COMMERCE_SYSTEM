# Project Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made on May 15, 2025

### 1. Directory Structure Creation
- Created separate directories for different types of files:
  - `Source_Files/`: All C++ source code (.cpp and .h files)
  - `Build_Files/`: Build artifacts (Makefile, object files, executable)
  - `Data_Files/`: Data storage files (accounts, products, logs)
  - `Documentation/`: All documentation files

### 2. File Movement
- Moved all source code files (.cpp and .h) to the Source_Files directory
- Moved Makefile, object files, and executable to the Build_Files directory
- Moved all data files to the Data_Files directory
- Moved documentation files to the Documentation directory

### 3. Makefile Updates
- Updated the Makefile to account for the new directory structure
- Added proper include paths for source files
- Modified build rules to handle files in different directories

### 4. File Path Updates
- Updated all file paths in source code to reference the new Data_Files directory
  - FileManager.cpp: Updated all paths to data files
  - ReportGenerator.cpp: Updated paths for report file generation

### 5. Helper Scripts
- Created `run_ecommerce.sh`: Script to build and run the application
  - Detects if source files have changed and rebuilds if necessary
  - Provides a simple way to run the application without manual steps

- Created `verify_structure.sh`: Script to verify project structure
  - Checks for required directories and files
  - Validates that all necessary components are present
  - Helps maintain the integrity of the project structure

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with new directory structure information
- Updated STRUCTURE.md with detailed documentation of the new organization
- Created DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with instructions for developers
- Created FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT.md outlining future enhancements

### 7. Git Repository
- Committed all changes to Git with appropriate descriptions
- Set up version control for the reorganized project

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Improved Organization**: Clear separation of different file types makes the project easier to navigate
2. **Better Maintainability**: Well-defined structure makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones
3. **Cleaner Build Process**: Build artifacts are isolated from source code, preventing clutter
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the structure helps onboard new developers
5. **Improved Workflow**: Helper scripts simplify common development tasks

## Next Steps

1. Implement enhancements outlined in FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT.md
2. Set up automated unit testing
3. Consider implementing a more sophisticated build system
4. Enhance error handling and user interface
